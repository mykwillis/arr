Behavior of One-Dimensional Binary Cellular Automata
-or-
Seeking Aperiodicity in Simple Systems

Mechanism
---------

A one-dimensional binary cellular automata is an array of binary digits (bits), whose values at any discrete time t are determined by the values of that element's immediate neighbors at time t-1.

The array is of finite length, and the complete state of the array at any time t is referred to as the configuration of the system at t.

The system's configuration is determined at any time t in terms of the state of each element.  Any element's state at time t is defined as:

	C[i](t) = F( L, R )

where

	C[i](t) is the value of the ith element of the configuration C at time t;

	L = C[i-1](t-1) is the value of the ith element's left-hand neighbor at time t-1;

	R = C[i+1](t+1) is the value of the ith element's right-hand neighbor at time t-1;

	F(L,R) is the progression function, described below.

That the system's behavior is defined entirely in terms of local interactions between elements is of primary interest.


Progression Functions
---------------------

In a binary automata, there are 16 possible progression functions F(L,R), corresponding to the 16 possible logic functions having two inputs and one output.  

 L   R   F(L,R)
---|---|--------
 0 | 0 | f1
 0 | 1 | f2
 1 | 0 | f3
 1 | 1 | f4


We name progression functions based on the values it places in the positions f1, f2, f3, and f4 in the truth table above.  For example, F[0000] produces 0 in response to any of the 4 possible input variations, corresponds to a truth table of:

 L   R   F[0000](L,R)
---|---|--------------
 0 | 0 | 0
 0 | 1 | 0
 1 | 0 | 0
 1 | 1 | 0


while F[1001] corresponds to a function that takes the value 1 for inputs (0,0) and (1,1), but is 0 for all others.  This is a truth table represented as:

 L   R   F[1001](L,R)
---|---|--------------
 0 | 0 | 1
 0 | 1 | 0
 1 | 0 | 0
 1 | 1 | 1


The names of progression functions are usually shortened to F[0] and F[9], corresponding to the decimal equivilent of the binary truth table outputs.
